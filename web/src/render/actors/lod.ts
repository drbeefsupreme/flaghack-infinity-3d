/**
 * Level of detail and shadow budgeting for the instanced actor batches (Flags, hippies).
 *
 * ActorView holds the frame's camera eye and frustum and bins every instance:
 *   - detailed: in view and close, drawn with the full model (and casting a shadow);
 *   - coarse caster: within ACTOR_SHADOW_RANGE of the eye but not detailed, drawn with the
 *     light model; it casts even when off screen because its shadow can fall into view;
 *   - coarse: in view beyond the shadow range, light model, colour pass only;
 *   - skip: off screen and beyond the shadow range.
 *
 * InstanceSet holds one level's per-instance attributes. Casters are written from the front
 * and colour-only instances from the back; finish() closes the gap, so the colour pass draws
 * instances [0, count) and the shadow pass [0, castCount) (see castShadowPrefix).
